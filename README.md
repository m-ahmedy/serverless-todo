# Serverless TODO

This project is a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# TODO items

The application stores TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `userId` (string) - a unique id for an the user which the item belongs to
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item


# Implemented functions

The following functions are fully implemented and configured in `serverless.yml` file:

* `Auth` - this function implements a custom authorizer for API Gateway that is added to all other functions.

* `GetTodos` - returns all TODOs for a current user. A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "todoId": "123",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Buy milk",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": false,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
    {
      "todoId": "456",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Send a letter",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": true,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
  ]
}
```

* `CreateTodo` - Creates a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives a new TODO item to be created in JSON format that looks like this:

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
  "name": "Buy milk",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": false,
  "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
}
```

It returns a new TODO item that looks like this:

```json
{
  "item": {
    "todoId": "123",
    "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
    "name": "Buy milk",
    "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
    "done": false,
  }
}
```

* `UpdateTodo` - updates a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file

It receives an object that contains three fields that can be updated in a TODO item:

```json
{
  "name": "Buy bread",
  "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
  "done": true
}
```

The id of an item that should be updated is passed as a URL parameter.

It returns an empty body.

* `DeleteTodo` - deletes a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.

It should return an empty body.

* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a pre-signed URL that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item.

It should return a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/image.png"
}
```

All functions are connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.

An id of a user can be extracted from a JWT token passed by a client.

All necessary resources has been added to the `resources` section of the `serverless.yml` file such as DynamoDB table and S3 bucket.


# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

No changes has been added to the fronted. The only file that was edited is the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. This file configures the client application just as it was done in the course and contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

## Authentication

Authentication is implemented in the application, It uses asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens as recommended.

# Best practices

This project follows the best practices indicated in lesson 6.

## Logging

This project utilizes [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger that creates [JSON formatted](https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/) log statements. it is used to write log messages like this:

```ts
import { createLogger } from '../../utils/logger'
const logger = createLogger('auth')

// You can provide additional information with every log statement
// This information can then be used to search for log statements in a log storage system
logger.info('User was authorized', {
  // Additional information stored with a log statement
  key: 'value'
})
```

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection, do the following.

Click on the import button:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-1.png?raw=true "Image 1")


Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true "Image 2")


Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true "Image 3")


Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true "Image 4")

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):

![Alt text](images/import-collection-5.png?raw=true "Image 5")
